### Analysis

In this analysis, the 45-day data was reviewed for 249 mice with SCC tumors that received different drug treatments. The main tratment focus was Capomulin. 

### Findings

The Capomulin treatment resulted in more effective results with lower tumor volumes towards the end of the research, compared to other treatments, with the exception of Ramicane, which also resulted in lower tumor volumes similar to Capomulin. There was a positive correlation between the average weight and the tumor volume, a correlation of .84, indicating that increased weight would yield in a larger tumor volume. For effective results, the suggestion would be to follow a Capomulin or Ramicane treatment.
